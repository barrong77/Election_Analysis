Election Analysis

Purpose:
The Elections Board has asked and employee (i.e.me) to perform an audit of election data.  The purpose is to determine how many votes were casted, the candidates of the election and the overall winner of the election.  In addition, the employee was tasked to provide a breakdown of the number of votes and % of total votes for each county, the county with the largest number of votes and breakdown of the number of votes each candidate received.

Election Audit Results
The following details and screen shots pertain to the election results:
-	Total Votes in the election were 369,711
-	Each Candidate’s total votes and percentage of votes:
o	Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
o	Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
o	Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
-	The winner of the election, winning vote count, and winning percentage of votes:
o	Winner: Diana DeGette
o	Winning Vote Count: 272,892
o	Winning Percentage: 73.8%
-	Each County and its total vote count:
o	Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
o	Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
o	Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
Included is a screen shot showing Election results from the text file loaded from the program called Visual Studio:

Election Audit Summary
The resources I used for the challenge were:
-Election Results.csv
-Software called Python 3.10.6

In Summary, I learned to use Python and Visual Studio.  I did the homework literally 4 times because I would get lost in some of the code and I could not figure out where I had missed a code.  Overall, Visual Studio is very helpful because the software will identify where the break in the code is and even sometimes explain how to fix the code.  For example, if you are needing an indent in the code.  
For the challenge, I just used the homework and basically went line for line to make sure I was coding similar.  I had my problems, for the longest time, I could not get the visual code to upload into the text file.  
The challenge just shows with some modifications to the homework script, the code can be used for any election.  Two examples to modify the script are changing total votes to total candidates and or changing winning candidate summary to winning votes summary.  The script could be used on any election at lets say for a High School President – Student Counsel.
